title: "Why the iPad Will Fail"
---

On the way to work today I had my [Nexus One][1] hooked up to the car stereo, streaming Pandora Radio. I had
Google Maps' [free turn-by-turn navigation feature][2] enabled, talking to me in case I was distracted and
forgot a turn. And I got a notification of a new email, which I responded to at a red light. All at the
same time. All without having to stop and restart each application. Pandora was streaming the whole time.
My turn-by-turn directions kept talking to me in the background. It was awesome.

I don't understand how iPhone owners deal with the constant starting and stopping of their applications.
And until the iPad OS can multi-task (and it may by the time it goes on sale) I don't see how the device can
succeed.
