title: "Why I'm Sticking With Obamacare"
category: personal
---

Near the end of this year I'm marrying my long-time girlfriend who happens to work at a big company that offers great health insurance benefits. I could get coverage through her plan essentially for free. But I'm sticking with my individual coverage through Obamacare. Here's why:

1. I believe decoupling insurance coverage from employers is an incredibly important issue.
2. I believe in individual responsibility.
3. I believe everyone should be protected from catastrophic health events beyond their control, and insurance is the best way to provide that protection.
4. In order to provide that insurance protection, healthy people need to subsidize the unhealthy rather than pulling out altogether.

I also want to support transparency and clarity in health insurance and health care, and the best way to do that is to cut out the major middle-man between consumers and their insurance plans: their employers.
