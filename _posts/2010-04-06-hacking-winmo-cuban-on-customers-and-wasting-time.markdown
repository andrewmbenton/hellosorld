title: "Hacking WinMo, Cuban on Customers and Wasting Time"
---

Today was a pretty slow tech news day. Nevertheless a few interesting reads:

* Wired describes the fad of hacking HTC Windows Mobile phones to [run Android instead][1].
* Mark Cuban explains why you should [never listen to your customers][2].
* And if you're looking to waste some time finding new domain names here's a good directory of [domain name tools][3]. I really like [NXdom][4].

Also I'll be attempting to build [Google's Chrome OS][5] later so look for a writeup of that.
