title: "Apple Doesn't Care Whether Your iPhone App Makes Money"
---

About a month ago I wrote an article about [Apple and iPhone apps][1], claiming that since the iPhone and iPhone apps
are complementary products, Apple has an incentive to keep apps cheap in order to sell more phones. A lot of people
thought I was wrong both here and on [Hacker News][2]. So in an effort to redeem what was perhaps a poorly-written
thesis, I present this update based on the discussions that followed.

I maintain that Apple is primarily a hardware company making [high margins][3] on each device it sells. Apple is happy
to keep doing this, since it's very very good at it. But being the intelligent marketers that they are, Apple's execs know
that people like to buy devices that can do loads of cool stuff. Enter iPhone apps and the App Store.

Since Apple isn't really a software company it must entice others to create applications for its devices. So far
it has wildly succeeded in achieving this with the iPhone (and iPod Touch), boasting over [200,000 apps][4] available
in the App Store. But quantity of apps isn't the only metric that matters. Price is also important. If all of those
200,000 apps cost $99, the App Store would be almost useless as a marketing tool since few could afford to buy many apps.

So Apple clearly has an incentive to create a commoditized app marketplace, where good apps are plentiful _and_
cheap. But this is exactly the situation that ["Strategy Letter V"][5] predicts for a product and its complements.
And based on information like [this][6], it's hard to deny that the App Store isn't already a commoditized marketplace.
Most apps are free or cost 99 cents regardless of quality or development cost.

Hence we see, at best, that Apple really doesn't care whether or not your iPhone app makes any money. As long as it
is good and inexpensive, Apple is happy to sell it for you (at cost though -- the 30% Apple takes from each app sale
is meant to cover the overhead of running the App Store). As an app developer, your incentives and Apple's are not at
all aligned.

Now don't get me wrong, Apple has every right to pursue what's best for itself according to its incentives. But let's
not hold any illusions that Apple has developers' best interests at heart.

P.S.

Interestingly "Strategy Letter V" also sheds light on the developer outrage surrounding Apple's [change to Article
3.3.1][7] in the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement. Just as Apple has an incentive to commoditize iPhone OS
software, software developers have an incentive to commoditize devices. How would they do that? By creating a software
abstraction layer that makes every device look the same to the applications above. And these kinds of abstraction
layers are exactly what the 3.3.1 change is designed to snuff out. It's an interesting battle with plenty of money to
be made and lost on both sides.
