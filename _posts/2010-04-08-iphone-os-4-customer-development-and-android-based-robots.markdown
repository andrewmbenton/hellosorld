title: "iPhone OS 4.0, some Customer Development and Android-based Robots"
---

Yes I have to link to the [iPhone OS 4.0 announcement][1] today. The new OS will support multitasking of some sort,
which means my main reason for [predicting the failure of the iPad][2] is now unfounded. There's bound to be a lot
of discussion around the new OS, which I will inevitably read and post about. Some other interesting stuff popped up
today:

* Steve Blank explains the [difference between a business plan and a business model][3]. (Hint: he thinks the former is a waste of time.)
* Some guys have developed a [robot called Truckbot][4] that runs on Android. They have more videos and interesting info over at [cellbots.com][5].

**Chrome OS build update**: I'm in day three now. I made the mistake of not compiling with a "local user" account
enabled, so I have to go back a few steps. It's been interesting though so far, and the guys in #chromium-os on IRC
have been very helpful.
