title: "More On Apple vs. Google Voice"
---

So I read another depressing account of what exactly happened with Apple's rejection of Google
Voice and, a couple weeks earlier, Google Latitude:

<http://gizmodo.com/5325539/apples-chickenshit-approval-process-has-gone-too-far>

The important contradictions are these:

>Yet here we are, Apple has rejected not one, but two Google apps that would deliver major new features
>to the iPhone, for reasons that are so obviously tripe it's insulting to even our non-exceptional
>intelligence. A Google Latitude app would confuse us? _Really?_ Because it would "use Google to serve
>maps tiles"? Wait. Isn't one of iPhone 3.0's major new features that it can use Google Maps inside of
>other applications? So like _every_ app can use Google to serve maps tiles. I admit, though, Latitude
>is a really big word. What does it even mean? That is pretty confusing. Maybe they should call it, like,
>Google Stalker.

>What happened with Google Voice is worse. Google didn't elaborate on the reason Apple gave for rejecting
>its official Google Voice app six weeks ago—and presumably, Google had more success wringing it out of Apple
>than most developers. Hours before Google broke the news, the developer of GV Mobile—a solid third-party app
>for Google Voice—said that it was being pulled from the App Store for "duplicating iPhone features." Then
>every other Google Voice application was silently killed too. Even though, reportedly, Apple's Phil Schiller

>BlackBerry on their network.

Apparently AT&T claim that they are not involved in the application approval process, so they can't speak
to this issue. I guess that's to be expected though, even if they were involved somehow.

So as I suggested before this looks like Apple hating on Google for some reason. I don't have a clue why though.
The article points out that Google gave the iPhone voice search and Maps and YouTube. Apple can't possibly
see Google's Chrome OS as a threat worthy of retaliation, since Chrome OS is meant for netbooks and Apple
doesn't compete in the netbook market (in fact, Apple thinks netbooks are stupid. See [here][1]). Unless
Apple is planning a major move toward building its own telephone network I don't see how this makes sense.

Anyway I'll repeat what I said yesterday; why buy a computer when the manufacturer can control what you
install, supposedly for your own good? I'll be sticking with Android for a long time...
