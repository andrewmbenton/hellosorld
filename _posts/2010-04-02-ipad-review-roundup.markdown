title: "iPad Review Roundup"

A few good iPad-related articles and reviews from yesterday and today. The Hacker News comments are
pretty interesting as well so I've linked to those too:

* Davig Pogue looks at the iPad [from two angles][1] in the New York Times.
* ([HN discussion][2])
* Cory Doctorow [won't be buying an iPad][3] and doesn't think you should either.
* ([HN discussion][4])
* John Gruber [sees things differently][5] in "The Kids Are All Right."
* ([HN discussion][6])

What's your favorite?
