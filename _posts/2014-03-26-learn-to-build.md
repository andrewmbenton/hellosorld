#### Learning To Code

I recently received an email from a friend who isn't a software engineer but is working at a well-known Silicon Valley tech company. She asked if I could recommend any good "basic coding courses" in order to learn enough to hang with the engineers.

Being a (mostly) self-taught engineer, I've gotten this question a few times. And the concept of "learning to code" outside of school is obviously gaining traction with a wide audience when even [Obama][1] is getting in on the act. Tools like [Codecademy][2] and [Khan Academy][4] as well as online courses like [Stanford's CS106A][5] will help you get your footing when just starting out.

Developers love that everyone in the world is now turning their heads towards technology and software and thinking "I should have studied computer science in college". We have adopted "learn to code" as a mantra, to be repeated to friends and family and colleagues when being pitched on a new app idea at the dinner table or the water cooler.

But "learning to code" is slightly off-putting to me, because it doesn't really encompass what programming and writing software is all about: actually building stuff.

#### Learn To Build

The phrase "learn to code" carries with it the subtle implication that "coding" or "programming" alone is a worthwhile end in itself. But it's really not. The phrase should be "learn to build". Code is a tool for building things. And since software is one of the most powerful thing a single person can build, it makes sense that more people should "learn to code".

But the learning can't stop there. Building is a frame of mind, not a skill. Coding is a skill.

So how can you learn to build? Most useful systems are very complicated to start completely from scratch, so don't. Tinker with a working system, make small changes, and expand the scope of your attempted changes as your confidence grows.

#### Get Hands On

Start with a basic programming course to get familiar with variables and data types and control structures and functions. You will develop an understanding of programming vocabulary that will help you to ask better questions, which is crucial when you run into roadblocks later (and there will be lots).

At the same time, start looking at work or at school for a software system designed or supported by someone you know that you use regularly but you think is broken in some simple way. It could be as small as an annoying phrase in an error message that you see all the time that you'd like to remove. Try to figure out some small problem to solve in an existing system.

Don't spend more than a couple of weeks on the basic programming concepts, unless you really enjoy it (and even then, move on after a month). As soon as you're comfortable with basic programming, get down to business: try to solve one of the small problems you've identified. The learning curve here will be quite steep at first, so it will help to have someone who knows about software available to chat with you. If not, try posting a question to the [/r/learnprogramming][6] subreddit.

Once you've solved one problem, or even just gotten the software you're trying to fix running on your computer, you'll feel a tendency to declare victory. Fight that tendency, take a celebratory lap (or nap), and dig in again. Bite off a bigger chunk. Find a new project to work on if you're bored with the current one. Talk to people about what you're working on and what you're learning to get ideas for what to do next.

Eventually you will have enough experience to build something mostly from scratch if you want to. This is an amazing position and you should absolutely take advantage of it if you have the time and desire. But even if not, you'll have developed the skill of identifying a problem, figuring out how to fix it, and then fixing it. And hopefully you'll be able to help the next person who comes along and wants to learn to build.

#### Problems You Will Face

The gatekeepers for the software system you're trying to fix won't want to let you have copies of the source code on your computer. Figure out how to make it happen anyway. Often times improving an internal tool or system at work or school will be far easier than improving an externally-facing thing due to political issues. Open source projects are also a good place to look if you run into too many roadblocks, since the code is already available to you (and everyone else in the world).

You won't know how to even make small changes at first. Because generally any system that's useful will also be very complicated. Don't worry. This is completely normal. Start by searching all of the files in the project for some words that you see in the interface of the thing you're working on. Once you find them, change one of the words to demonstrate your immense power to manipulate the computer and bend it to your will.

You will get discouraged. Again, most things are very complicated. Ask someone who knows how the system works about what you are struggling to do. As long as you are trying to make a positive change most people will be happy to help you out. And if you demonstrate that you've put in real effort to understand as much as you can (by having good questions) then it should be easy to convince people to help you. Of course there will be exceptions, but those people are jerks who live pathetic lives and you should ignore them.

#### The Endgame

What happens after you learn to build? You do it again. You learn to iterate. You learn that nothing is ever finished, and everything can be improved. You learn how to decide which things are worth improving given limited resources.

And all along you share the knowledge of how to build with those around you, so that you can all build together.
