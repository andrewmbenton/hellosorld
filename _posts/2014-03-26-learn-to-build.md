title: "Learning To Build"

I recently received an email from a friend who isn't a software engineer but is working at a well-known Silicon Valley tech company. She asked if I could recommend any good "basic coding courses" in order to learn enough to hang with the engineers.

As a (mostly) self-taught engineer I tend to get asked this question a lot. And as more people grow up using computers at home and at school and at their jobs, it only seems natural that more people will want to learn to program computers. Even [President Obama][1] is asking Americans to spend a little time learning to code.

The technical community has supported this growing interest with a variety of course-like tools and materials to help people get started:

* [Codecademy][2]
* [Khan Academy][4]
* [Stanford's CS106A][5]
* [Code.org][3]

These are all great resources to get started. And they may well help you "learn to code".

Software engineers love that everyone in the world is now turning their heads towards their chosen profession and thinking "I should have studied computer science in college".

But the phrase "learn to code" carries with it the subtle implication that "coding" or "programming" alone is a worthwhile end in itself.

The phrase should be "learn to build". Code is a tool for building things. And since software is one of the most powerful thing a single person can build, it makes sense that more people should "learn to code".

But the learning can't stop there. Building is a frame of mind, not a skill. Coding is a skill.

So how can you learn to build? Most useful systems are very complicated to start completely from scratch, so don't. Tinker with a working system, make small changes, and expand the scope of your attempted changes as your confidence grows.

### My Advice

Start with a basic programming course to get familiar with variables and data types and control structures and functions. You will develop an understanding of vocabulary that will help you to ask better questions, which is crucial when you run into roadblocks later (and there will be lots).

At the same time, start looking at work or at school for a software system designed or supported by someone you know that you use regularly but you think is broken in some simple way. It could be as small as an annoying phrase in an error message that you see all the time that you'd like to remove. Try to figure out some small problem to solve.

Don't spend more than a couple of weeks on the basic programming concepts, unless you really enjoy it (and even then, move on after a month). As soon as you're comfortable with basic programming, get down to business: try to solve one of the small problems you've identified. The learning curve here will be quite steep at first, so it will help to have someone who knows about software available to chat with you. If not, <make some kind of support-chat recommendation>. 

### Problems You Will Face

The gatekeepers for the software system you're trying to fix won't want to let you have copies of the source code on your computer. Figure out how to make it happen anyway. Often times improving an internal tool or system at work or school will be far easier than improving an externally-facing thing due to political issues. Open source projects are also a good place to look if you run into too many roadblocks, since the code is already available to you (and everyone else in the world).

You won't know how to even make small changes at first. Because generally any system that's useful will also be very complicated. Don't worry. This is completely normal. Start by searching all of the files in the project for some words that you see in the interface of the thing you're working on. Once you find them, change one of the words to demonstrate your immense power to manipulate the computer and bend it to your will.

You will get discouraged. Again, most things are very complicated. Ask someone who knows how the system works about what you are struggling to do. As long as you are trying to make a positive change most people will be happy to help you out. And if you demonstrate that you've put in real effort to understand as much as you can (by having good questions) then it should be easy to convince people to help you. Of course there will be exceptions, but those people are jerks who live pathetic lives and you should ignore them.

The Endgame

What happens after you learn to build? You do it again. You learn to iterate. You learn that nothing is ever finished, and everything can be improved. You learn how to decide which things are worth improving given limited resources.

And all along you share the knowledge of how to build with those around you, so that you can all build together.
