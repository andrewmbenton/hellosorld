title: "My Triumphant Return to Blogging"
category: personal

It's been almost exactly three years since I last wrote anything here. No, I'm not dead, and I wasn't doing nothing. I spent 2.5 years as an engineer at Twilio (a telecom startup), traveled to London, Cape Town, Berlin, Freiburg, the Bolivian Amazon and the Argentine wine-country, and I just recently got engaged.

But this won't be an update on the last three years. Mostly I just need to write
something so that I'll be embarassed if I stop. I need to commit myself, by
possibly (hopefully) exposing myself to the public ridicule that will surely
ensue if I fail to write something *at least once a week.*

So I need your help. Please set up a reminder for a week from now to come back to this page and check for new material. If there is none, feel free to let me know how disappointed you are through as many channels as you can think of, both public and private.

If there is indeed another post, you may then congratulate me on my triumphant return to blogging.
