This is a follow up to my post "here":http://hellosorld.com/personal/2009/07/23/submitting-to-social-networks.html. Basically I've been fooling around with Google Analytics and wanted to post some numbers.

These are the referral numbers I got after submitting links to this blog on three social network sites:

|_<{padding:0 50px 0 0}.site|_<{padding:0 10px 0 0}.referrals|_<{padding:0 10px 0 0}.pages/visit|_<{padding:0 10px 0 0}.avg time here|
|Facebook|14|3.64|3'58"|
|Twitter|2|2.5|2'09"|
|Digg|2|1|0'0"|

So not only did Facebook provide the most referrals but the highest quality referrals as well. People coming to the site from Digg apparently left immediately. Surprisingly enough a couple people from Twitter found the blog and actually stuck around. And one of them was from Germany.

I'll probably post more GA numbers here soon since I'm spending a lot of time looking at them...
