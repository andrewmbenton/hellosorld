Yes there is a difference between a web site and a web app, or at least there's a distinction I will try
to flush out. I may edit and amend this post as I come up with better ways to explain it.

Almost everything on the web today has a bit of app flavor to it, so I certainly don't want to give the
impression that web sites and web apps are mutually exclusive.
