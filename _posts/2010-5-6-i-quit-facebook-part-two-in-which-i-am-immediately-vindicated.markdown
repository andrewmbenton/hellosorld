title: "I Quit Facebook Part II: In Which I Am Immediately Vindicated"
---

So I [quit Facebook][1] a couple of days ago. Not completely, but I disabled my account. I think I'm going to delete it
completely after finding out today that Facebook is [adding "applications"][2] to our profiles just for visiting other
websites. And there's no clear way to disable this behavior.

Unfortunately I don't think many people will care about this, although I think most people should. Facebook will
probably keep on growing. But at least one guy thinks [Facebook is dying][3]. I'm not sure I see Facebook dying
anytime soon, but I can see it relegated to a niche community, kind of like MySpace is still used by musicians. Who
will still be on Facebook in five years? I'm guessing mostly [older women][4].
