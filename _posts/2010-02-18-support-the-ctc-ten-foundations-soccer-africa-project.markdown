Support CTC10: [buy a $25 raffle ticket][1] and you could win $2500!

The CTC Ten Foundation was formed in honor of Christopher Campbell, my girlfriend's younger brother, who
passed away suddenly in 2007. He was 21. The foundation carries out a mission to help children through
soccer. With the generous support of Chris's family and friends, last year the foundation planned and built the
brand new [Christopher Campbell Memorial Soccer Field][2] in [Khayelitsha Township][5] on the outskirts of Capetown,
South Africa. The foundation has since erected a clubhouse at the field for community
events and AIDS education for children, and the field has even hosted some [famous visitors][3].
