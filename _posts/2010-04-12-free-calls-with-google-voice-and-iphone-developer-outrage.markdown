title: "Free Calls with Google Voice and iPhone Developer Outrage"
---

I just remembered that a couple months ago I found this awesome resource on [setting up Google Voice with a VoIP service][1] (since
Google Voice isn't actually VoIP) for unlimited free calling, so figured I might as well link
to it today. Oh, and there was a bit of an [explosion of discontent][2] over the weekend after Apple [snuck in a
seemingly minor change][3] to its iPhone developer's license agreement. A lot of developers are finally beginning to
see Apple for the ogreish beast it has become.

**Chrome OS build update**: I've been spending some time reading posts on the [chromium-os-dev list][4]. Still no luck
on figuring out what I'm doing wrong during the build process. I've posted to the group so maybe I can get some
help that way. I'm committed to getting Chrome OS up and running though.
